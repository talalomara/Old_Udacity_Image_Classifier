# Old Udacity Image Classifier

Most of this code was taken from the project's files. Only documents with my name on it has any contributions made by me.

## Project Goal

Given a pretrained, mostly completed image classifier, the goal was to complete the code. To fill in the blanks, if you will. It would take a varying array of dog images and determine which image belonged to which breed. In addition to this, the classifier was capable of determining which images were not actually dogs. 


## CNN Model Architectures

This project had me using ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG to find the best among them for the job.

## Findings

As it turns out, the best model at finding the difference between a dog and not a dog was VGG. Not only that, but it was able to land the highest accuracy at determining dog breeds as well as label placements for not-dog images.
